        <h1>Congratulaions(?) You've made it. You've done it.</h1>
        <p><h2>I'm going to be seirous for a moment, which is bizarre because I'm almost never serious. Ever since I met you, I've always made the joke of having an OnlyFans. 
        Originally, I started joking about it because I didn't know how you would react to having a sex worker as a friend. It was my way of testing the waters to make sure that
        I wouldn't be ostricized for what I do. I was so scared to actually be serious and tell you about it. In fact, if I'm being completely honest, I'm horrified to share this 
        with you. But I realize now that you are what I identify as a "safe person:" someone I can trust to talk to and confide a lot in. I really appreciate the support that 
        you've given me over the course of our friendship. Many people have entirely cut me off because of the methods I use to support myself. Even if you think you haven't 
        supported me, please know that small things like not being disgusted at me or disappointed in me for selling pictures of myself on the internet to get by is really 
        validating. I seriously can't thank you enough. Now, enough being sappy and emotional... the search is over. I now bestow upon to you the forbidden link-- the link to my 
        OnlyFans. I'm not forcing you to click the link, I've just always joked that I'd show it to you guys one day, and that day is today. Obviously, I have a few rules regarding
        all of this for the sake of the both of us, but I trust you enough to repsect me. Again, thank you. You don't know how much it means to me :)</h2></p>
